# Spatially-resolved Se concentration in maize grain for estimating Se apparent intake in Malawi

Assessing dietary Se intake in Malawi using the Malawi Integrated Household Survey, Wave 4 (2014-2015) and geo-reference maize Se data from the GeoNutrition. 

**Scripts in repo:**

01. ihs4/5 - cleaning scripts (up to AFE): 
This can be obtained using the manual (REF)

02. ihs - HH location identification (buffer + district method)
This can be adapted from the repo of geospatial model

03. ihs NCT - cleaning scripts (from framework)
This can be adapted from the framework and/or Tanzania training

04. georeference maize and products database (using 02.)
This can be adapted from Lark, Botoman et al., script

05. combining georeference maize + NCT
Same as above

06. calculating apparent intakes & risk of inadequacy
Same as abover
